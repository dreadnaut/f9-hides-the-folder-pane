# F9 Hides the Folder Pane

This [Thunderbird](https://thunderbird.net) extension adds a shortcut to
hide and show the Folder Pane. That's the tree of accounts and folders on the
left side of main Thunderbird view. It's useful, but sometimes you have a small
screen, or a lot of email!

## Why F9

There is currently no keyboard shortcut for this function, but there is an open
[feature request](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=874017)
to add `F9`. The key is unused and sits next to `F8`, the shortcut to toggle the
visibility of the Message Pane.

Install this add-on to live in the future. Help develop the feature request
above to make it obsolete üëç

## How to install
